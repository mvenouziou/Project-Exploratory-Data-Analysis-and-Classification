Clean, potable water is a basic human need. Beyond mere access to water, proximity to a
reliable water source is a major factor in determining the educational and economic
opportunities available to adjacent communities. Because of this, the development and
maintenance of water sources in remote and/or impoverished communities is a major area of
focus for many government and nonprofit humanitarian organizations. 

This paper develops a predictive model for determining the maintenance needs of water pumps
in Tanzania. Specifically, this is a supervised learning problem to classify pumps as functional,
in need of repair or completely inoperable. The model achieves 79.63% predictive accuracy on
the DrivenData test set using decision tree models.
